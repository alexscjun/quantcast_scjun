# quantcast_challenge

This Java project uses JUnit and Maven. Python scripts were used to generate test files, which can be found in the notebook folder.

Run the project with:
```
./most_active_cookie [path] [flag] [date]
```

Run JUnit maven tests with:
```
./most_active_cookie_test [path] [flag] [date]
```

Note: the test files are in a subfolder, so update path appropriately.
